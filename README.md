# AI Act Questions

AI Act questions based on AI Act defintions and the definition of High Impact Algorithm in the Algorithm Registery guidance by the Dutch Ministry of the Interior (https://algoritmes.pleio.nl/attachment/entity/f1a35292-7ea6-4e47-93fa-b3358e9ab2e0).

The questions are developed in collaboration with the Muncipality of Amsterdam.

The templates are available in JSON format and can be easily customized to fit the specific needs of an organization.

# How it works

The JSON schema's use the [React JSON Schema Form (RJSF) library](https://github.com/rjsf-team/react-jsonschema-form), this library is built on top of: [Json schema's](https://json-schema.org/) which should make it easy to implement the schema's in your own tech stack.
Please read the [RSJF documentation](https://rjsf-team.github.io/react-jsonschema-form/docs/) for information about how the forms and dependencies work.

Changes we made to the original specification:

### 1. Output

The templates should return an outcome after the questions, to show this result we trigger the results component when the question key is `output`. For example:

```json
"output": {
    "type": "string",
    "title": "Uitslag",
    "default": "Uw toepassing is op basis van uw antwoorden waarschijnlijk een impactvol algoritme."
}
```

This allows us to have multiple different outcomes in one template that each are triggered based on a unique combination of dependencies.

In case a form ends without an `output` question we automatically trigger an error component.

### 2. Intermediate output

To show intermediate outputs or simple text messages to the user we trigger a classname on such elements, to prevent the content from rendering as an input. This is done by adding the following uiSchema definition:

```json
"outputIntermediate": {
    "ui:widget": "textarea",
    "ui:classNames": "intermediate-output"
}
```

In this example we trigger this for the input element `outputIntermediate` but this mechanism can be used for any question.

# How to run

## Prerequisites

Ensure the following are installed on your system:

Node.js (version 14 or later)
npm (Node Package Manager, comes with Node.js) or yarn (an alternative package manager)
To check if you have these installed, run the following commands in your terminal:

```bash
node -v
npm -v
```

##### 1. Clone the repository to your local machine. Open your terminal and run:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/NGO-Algorithm-Audit/AI-Act-Implementation-Tool.git
cd your-repo-name
```

##### 3. Once inside the project directory, install the necessary packages by running:

```bash
# If you use npm
npm install

# Or, if you prefer yarn
yarn install
```

##### 4. After the dependencies are installed, start the development server with:

```bash
# If using npm
npm run dev

# Or, if using yarn
yarn dev
```

This command will compile and serve the application. By default, it should be accessible at http://localhost:5173 in your web browser.

# Styling overrides

With these css variables defined in the root where the frontend is injected the default theming can be overriden.

```css
:root {
  --host-primary: #4caf50;
  --host-primary-dark: #388e3c;
  --host-primary-darker: #2e7d32;
  --host-body-bg: #e8f5e9;
}
```
